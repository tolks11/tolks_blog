title: 'Midterm Outlook: Gaming to DeFi Supercycle '
metaDescription: >-
  An exploration of the factors and potential outcome where crypto-gaming
  reaches exit velocity while DeFi protocols are the underlying/backend
  facilitating the value transfer occurring within the games

Exploration of gaming feeding DeFi as DeFi (dexes/lending protocols) are the backend that facilitates the transfer of the assets inside the games that reach exit velocity 

Key Points

Playbook/User retention established with Axie 

ALT L1s' that don't have gaming with struggle to compete 

Gaming --> DeFi --> Protocol Growth/reinvestment/more applications --> repeat cycle over and over

Game Theory of user retention/benefits of crypto-gaming and how everything will adapt (similar to web3 game theory of user's inventories as well)

SOL --> Aurory, Star Atlas (short, mid, long term), NINJA, CryoWars, MiniRoyale

ETH --> ImmutableX building supporting quickly --> liquidity/fragmentation of users/assets/rollups in the mid to longish term as all of that bridging and interoperability is solved 

Although, ETH would capture the most value as the fees of transfer of all assets within a game that reaches exit velocity are burnt through EIP-1559 

DeFi Kingdom --> Harmony?



Figure out user retention/growth during recent crypto drawdowns correlated with Axie --> i.e. was there a dipo in users, growth, activity when crypto markets saw quick retraces --> admitdely a sample of 1, but unchartered territory here while the only evidence we do have is Axie growth is sticky, that of normal user retention of \~actual jobs\~
