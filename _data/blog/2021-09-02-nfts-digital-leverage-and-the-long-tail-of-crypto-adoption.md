The catalyst behind broad crypto adoption has been speculated on since before the first genesis block of any chain was mined.  One of the first examples of this was Hal Finney, a BTC and crypto pioneer, in an email sent in 1993.  Hal wrote, "We're buying and selling 'cryptographic trading cards'.  Fans of cryptography will love these fascinating examples of the cryptographic arts.  Notice the fine way the bit patterns fit together - a mix of one-way functions and digital signatures, along with random blinding.  What a perfect conversation piece to be treasured and show to your friends and family...They come in all kinds of varieties, from the common 1's, to the rarer 50's, all the way up to the seldom-seen 1000's. "  With the obvious benefit of hindsight, we can map this concept directly to the explosive growth of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) today.  Fittingly, I think NFTs will usher in widespread crypto adoption.  While NFTs could be distilled down to a single sentence (NFTs are interoperable, programmable, verifiable representations of digital objects), the practicality and implementation this enables leaves infinite possibilities.  The two core NFT use cases I think will lead to massive secular growth are digital leverage and gaming.
