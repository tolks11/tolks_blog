The catalyst behind broad crypto adoption has been speculated on since before the first genesis block of any chain was mined.  One of the first examples of this was Hal Finney, a BTC and crypto pioneer, in an email sent in 1993.  Hal wrote, "We're buying and selling 'cryptographic trading cards'.  Fans of cryptography will love these fascinating examples of the cryptographic arts.  Notice the fine way the bit patterns fit together - a mix of one-way functions and digital signatures, along with random blinding.  What a perfect conversation piece to be treasured and show to your friends and family...They come in all kinds of varieties, from the common 1's, to the rarer 50's, all the way up to the seldom-seen 1000's. "  With the obvious benefit of hindsight, we can map this concept directly to the explosive growth of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) today.  Fittingly, I think NFTs will usher in widespread crypto adoption.  While NFTs could be distilled down to a single sentence (NFTs are interoperable, programmable, verifiable representations of digital objects), the practicality and implementation this enables leaves infinite possibilities.  The two core NFT use cases I think will lead to massive secular growth are digital leverage and gaming.

## Digital Leverage

Over the past several years (drastically increased by COVID-19), being digitally native is now an expectation.  Everything and everyone from companies and brands of all sizes, to any form of organization to individual people are consistently improving their digital presence.  What is new, is the realization and experimentation with digital leverage.  Digital leverage can be summarized with an excerpt from an excellent [post](https://j.mirror.xyz/) by John Palmer where he says, "for entire broad categories of software, if an application doesn't recognize that people hold inventories, it won't be compelling to users.  As we move into the future, more people on the Internet will be accumulating their own inventories of digital objects and won't want to spend time in software that forces them to 'start over'".  NFTs, and crypto broadly, enable interoperable composability that we're just beginning to explore.  

Digital leverage applied to the ownership that he is referring to, i.e. if I can't bring my digital assets (inventory) to new software/internet things then forget it and you're operating a disadvantage going forward.

Can't port game assets in the future, no go

Can't transfer ownership of digital item, no go

Can't port followers/likes/accomplishments etc., no go 

Digital presence/ownership worth more than physical at scale and ability to leverage marginal cost increase in producing more goods (think software at scale)

Recently seen the value in digital presence and marketing after witnessing digital business models become more valuable than physical stores.  Digital goods operate in the same comparison where the TAM is infinitely more vast than the physical world due to obvious constraints that don't apply online.

Digital leverage also creates access, community, and identity.  We're already seeing the beginning of what leveraging a NFT (in this case as a profile picture can enable).  Whether it's cryptopunks, BAYC (Bored Ape yacht Club), or some other PfP (Profile Picture), you are immediately welcomed into that specific community and sometimes even granted access to Discord servers, community get togethers, etc.  This trend is not new and has existed as long as humans have.  Whether it's religion, profile pictures, sports fandom, niche interests, politics, country flags, etc. there is a community you belong to.  This is exacerbated in the Web 3.0 and NFT realm through the combination of skin in the game and true ownership.  Buying an NFT to participate in a community has real economic costs compared to putting a hashtag or flag emoji in your bio.  NFTs and PfPs create digital leverage in the fact that you can access these communities and participate in the economic growth and expansion of said community along with the other members.  

## Gaming & the M Word

The single largest community in the world is that of gamers.  According to Statista [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748044/number-video-gamers-world/), there were 2.69 billion active video gamers worldwide in 2020 with that total estimated to grow to 3.07 billion by 2025.  More Statista data shows that in-game purchases reached a staggering $54 billion dollars in 2020.  Gaming, along with internet growth and penetration, are two of the highest growth sectors not only of the past 10+ years, but expected future growth as well.  There's only one industry that as grown at a faster pace and that is the crypto economy.  Things become extremely interesting when combining crypto backed economic systems with games.  The M word (Metaverse) has been unavoidable recently for this reason.  

List the market and numbers, connect to Axie Infinity and other blockchain/crypto games  (Star Atlas) and how blockchains, NFTs, tokens will completely transform the future of gaming as people can earn, or not lose! money while having actual ownership and composability between items in separate gaming worlds 

Play to earn and Axie Infinity {few links including mine}, again Axie reinforced the incentive alignment that players and developers have to ensure the game is operating as well as possible and growing the entire ecosystem

Gaming and profitability from as the gateway to true digital ownership, value then flowing to more financial assets fro the masses 

two-way economies inside games where players can benefit, contribute, and grow the total value of the game economy compared to the previous walled gardens and one-way value transfers (users pay for game items with no ownership) of previous games

As writing this, opened an email from Star Atlas with some development updates and announcements.  One of these was a brand partnership between Star Atlas and Animoca Brands that read, "through this groundbreaking cross-platform collaboration, we will cross-license intellectual property, and further empower true digital ownership in making in-game items permanent assets in a self-sustainable player-owned economic system."

## Other things NFTs enable

* Crypto Enabled Attributes 

  * interoperable, composable, permisionless, global coordination that is applicable to the entire crypto ecosystem including NFTs and fungible tokens 
  * incentive alignment--coordination and open contribution of protocols allows for beneficial growth to the entire ecosystem 
  * users, participants, developers, etc. all have the same economic benefit and ownership of the protocol, NFT, or token which inherently creates massive network effects on a global scale 
* Sports Collectibles & Ticketing

  * NBA Topshot (soon every major sports league) -- ability to own your favorite player's best plays and a derivative speculation on the future improvement of specific players
  * See rich history of sports cards/memorabilia -- next logical step is leveraging the ease of access, composability, and permanent ownership that crypto enables
  * Beginning to see the earliest experimentation of event ticketing NFTs corresponding to traditional ticketing with the added benefit of building in more utility, rewards, interoperability that NFTs enable
* Fractionalization & Liquidity 

  * [fractional.art ](https://fractional.art/)
  * ability to mint NFTs representing real world items or not, and then fractionalize their ownership into fungible tokens that can be used as collateral, to lend and borrow, increase liquidity and access
  * Already happening with high value NFTs such as cryptopunks but also easy to imagine a future where this applies to real-estate, home-ownership, cars, high-value tangible assets (wine, irl art, rare items, etc.)
* Verifiable Representation of Accomplishments 
* Programmable Money (better word here)
* Ownership and participation in Web 3.0 

  * NFTs as the core economic element of the next-generation digital economy 
  * Allow ownership and financial benefit from social capital at a global scale that represents the vast and exponentially increasing of online interactions/items we consume 

## So, what now?

Ultimately, the bull case for NFTs and crypto adoption continually reverts back to some of the core crypto enabled concepts applicable to both NFTs and fungible tokens.  Globally accessible, digital assets that are interoperable, permisionless, and composable have unlimited design space and hyperspeed feedback loops that allow more flexibility, interoperability, lower marginal costs, and lower barriers to entry.  

Applicable to current markets--> SOL/ETH, SOL as the gaming and low value, high throughput settlement layer while ETH settles mid-high value transfers and certain DeFi protocols.  Symbiotic relationship between the two moving forward? 

How do you price the ability to transfer, value, profit, true ownership of previously intangible digital assets?????
