Publish MVP today focus on t***hreading the needle of crypto disrupting and distributing power from big tech, while also holding the belief that crypto and tech will become symbiotic over the next 10 years and beyond.***  

There are two common diatribes that slowly seem to be interconnected.  They've both been around for about the same time, and are facing an increasing amount of regulatory scrutiny but they couldn't be farther apart in their respective ethos and goals.  Of course, I'm talking about Big Tech and Crypto.  While the attacks on each have grown over the past few years, it seems as if they are becoming lumped together in a giant zero-sum game against the environment and the end consumer.  By the end of reading, I hope to present a compelling case that not only can crypto return power and choice to the consumer, but it can do so while **rewarding them** and letting them be active participants in the networks that can disrupt Big Tech.

The two main crypto assets (along with brief examples of potential disruptors) we'll be exploring that provide the optionality of **choice to participate, rewards for participating, and share in economic upside** are Helium and Axie Infinity.  While Axie clearly falls into the gaming category, both of these networks fall more broadly into a sub-sector of the crypto industry that I think will simultaneously disrupt and create a synergistic relationship with tech, Web 3.0.  [Mason Nystrom](https://twitter.com/masonnystrom) of [Messari](https://messari.io/), wrote one of the best descriptions of Web3 saying, "Web3 manifests through new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, virtual and augmented reality, AI, and more.  Empowered by new technologies, the Web3 movement is spearheaded by a shift in how we, the collective, view and value the Internet.  Web3 is about creating an Internet that works for the people, owned by the people.

## Helium, The People's Network

Directly from Helium's official site, they say, "**By deploying a simple device on your home or office, you can provide your city with miles of low-power network coverage for billions of devices and earn a new cryptocurrency, HNT."**  Helium refers to itself as The People's Network because the core idea is placing a small, router like device inside your home/office (although they've expanded to more complex and wider ranging outdoor products as well) that takes a non-performance effecting amount of bandwidth from your internet provider and repurposes it for IoT (internet of things) LoRa capabilities.  This LoRa is provided to IoT companies (think smart devices that don't require high bandwidth to transfer data) ranging from thermostats to scooters to smart sprinkler systems to parking meters to dog trackers, etc. for a price to the IoT provider.  The data is paid for in Data Credits that can be purchased with HNT.  The Helium hotspot distributes miner rewards for providing proof of coverage (similar but obviously different from proof of work BTC and proof of stake blockchains) and verifying the Helium Network that you can then sell for other crypto assets, convert to stablecoins (dollar pegged cryptocurrencies) and transfer to your bank, or simply hold the HNT for price appreciation.  

The entire crypto-economic structure is obviously more complicated and you can read their [tokenomics](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/helium-token/#data-credits-and-burn-and-mint-economics) [](http://whitepaper.helium.com/)for more if you'd like, but I think the general idea is clear.  Syphon a trivial amount of bandwidth from your internet provider you wouldn't use to begin with, and get rewarded for providing coverage and helping to expand the network. This may seem a bit abstract and complex but in practice it's extremely simple.  There are an endless amount of YouTube videos and documentation to help you set your hotspot up, but it's a few simple steps that essentially boils down to plugging a router into an outlet.  Upkeep and the complexity of the system is managed entirely inside the hotspot as the official Helium [mining documentation](https://docs.helium.com/blockchain/mining/) states, "Once your Hotspot is completely deployed and fully synced with the Helium blockchain, you as the owner are not required to do anything else in order to earn HNT.  Your Hotspot will perform all of the above activities while it runs."

## Amazon & Big Tech

 A few weeks ago Amazon received a negative press onslaught for releasing a product they call Amazon Sidewalk. 

![press about Amazon Sidewalk](/assets/Screen Shot 2021-06-25 at 12.36.33 AM.png)

Here is how Amazon describes Sidewalk from there official site, "**Amazon Sidewalk creates a low-bandwidth network with the help of Sidewalk Bridge devices including select Echo and Ring devices.  These Bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth which is pooled together to provide these services to you and your neighbors.  And when more neighbors participate, the network becomes even stronger."**  Huh, sounds familiar.  Now, these two services are not in direct competition but even if that was the case, the competition is not what matters here.  What is far more important, in my opinion, is the difference in incentives, data privacy, choice, and economic value provided to the consumer.  

As you saw, there was massive backlash to this announcement for a few key reasons.  First, Amazon chose to retroactively apply this upgrade to all existing Echo/Ring devices and make the terms **opt-out**.  If you were not aware of this upgrade, it just kind of went live and you may never have any idea that it's happening.  Obviously, in today's tech landscape creating anything that is inherently opt-in is a bold decision that is asking for regulatory scrutiny.  Second, there's no additional benefit to the Ring/Echo users.  Again, it's just happening unless you opt-out, and even if you opt-in you aren't rewarded other than marginally increased performance for your Ring/Echo.  This can also be summarized by a great [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/amirhaleem/status/1391440448107913216) from the  CEO of Helium explaining the differences between the two networks and reinforcing that they're not direct competitors.

Compare the previous paragraph to what we know about Helium.  Helium is opt-in (with an up front cost of $300-$500 for a hotspot) while Sidewalk is automatically enabled.  Sidewalk participants don't see an increase in value while Amazon gets access to more data.  Helium hotspot owners are rewarded for coverage in the HNT token, currently trading at $12.09 per HNT (rewards vary on a number of factors).  The future price of the HNT token is correlated with future network growth, further benefitting the end consumer while Sidewalk participants are largely not rewarded.  

Helium also recently announced a partnership with FreedomFi which provides open source Private LTE or 5G networks from comparable router like devices that will soon incorporate HNT rewards.  What you're presented with when navigating to FreedomFI's website is, "Open 5G for everyone.  Open Software. Commodity Hardware.  Cloud-Native Architecture."  The explosive growth of the Helium network and success with IoT companies, has allowed them the ability to expand and they have their roadmap now focused on 5G.  It's certainly an ambitious goal, but it seems likely in the near future that we'll have self-supporting, open Internet access and 5G capabilities while being rewarded for providing the service as a distributed consensus that you can see below is rapidly expanding and benefitting from network effects.

EXPAND ON NETWORK EFFECTS BASIC PRINCIPAL APPLIED TO HELIUM, greater coverage, more challenges, more rewards 

There are many arguments today, predominately from the mainstream, that cryptocurrencies are worthless, energy-burning piles of garbage that have no use cases.  While there are certainly hundreds to thousands of crypto assets this applies to, there are also some providing new, emerging ways to benefit and empower consumers all while rewarding them as the network grows.  In a sea of "what does crypto actually do", this use case and comparison seems so direct and simple.  The mechanisms of the service in each instance require a bit of something you already have, while one **rewards you and let's you participate in future growth**, the other provides minimal value to the end consumer (not a one to one comparison of competing services but seems naive to think Amazon wouldn't rapidly expand and scale this service to IoT and 5G).  A lot of crypto use cases can be extremely extract, but this use case is clear, direct, measurable (see local hotspot rewards in your area [here](https://explorer.helium.com/coverage#2.2/39.83/-65.58)) and empowers the end consumer all uniquely enabled by blockchains and crpyto-economic design.  Next, we'll take a look at another crypto economic model benefiting users with potentially massive real-world consequences.  

## Axie Infinity, Play to Earn, & Reward Mechanisms

Another story that you might have seen or heard about in passing over the past couple weeks centers around Axie Infinity.  Axie is a blockchain based game that can be thought of similar to Pokemon.  What's different from Pokemon is the ability to earn crypto while you play.  Players have the ability to earn NFTs or crypto assets through battling, breeding, trading, and selling digital pets.  From Lean Callon-Butler in an article titled, "For Filipinos, Axie Infinity is More Than a Crypto Game" (article [here](https://www.coindesk.com/for-filipinos-axie-infinity-is-more-than-a-crypto-game)), "Axie Infinity is a leading game in the emerging play-to-earn movement, where players of blockchain games can earn yield in the form of tokens or other rewards.  Those rewards can be used in-game, or they can be traded on an open market if the player chooses.  The latter option represents an important shift in the gaming world because traditionally in-game assets were confined to the centralized protocol from where they came, unable to be moved off the platform."  Here, "moved off the platform" is taking shape in providing income, **greater than** the Philippines minimum wage, for players who earn in the game, convert to a stablecoin (pegged $1, likely Tether or USDC), and use that stablecoin to directly cover their cost of living.   

CNBC has a good [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/people-in-philippines-earn-cryptocurrency-playing-nft-video-game-axie-infinity.html) and breakdown of how the game works saying that, "Axie Infinity uses NFTs for the rights to each pet that is purchased.  To grow these pets or breed them, you purchase SLPs (small-love potions).  You can then sell these pets or SLPs for cryptocurrency and swap into your respective currency."  As mentioned above, and referenced from Filipino participants quoted in the article, this game is supporting families and providing opportunities to already marginalized communities severely impacted by COVID-19.  This clearly presents another example of a uniquely blockchain enabled technology providing real-world economic value and shows the ability to design crypto-economic systems where participants are rewarded for participating and can benefit from global, borderless network effects.  It shouldn't be surprising that an emerging market is quick to adopt the game as there have been endless stories and anecdotes of people in Latin America in Africa using crypto assets for what they uniquely enable, avoiding capital/authoritarian controls, the devaluation of currencies, and remittances.  All of these are often cited from people in the emerging market economies and are oft ignored by the person sitting in a Manhattan apartment, pontificating about how crypto is useless to them while dismissing the paradigm shift that is the ability to trustlessly participate in borderless systems that allow the transfer of value. 

This is evidenced farther by the closing quote of the CNBC article from a mother of three in the documentary you can check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQZr0KpbWfc).  She says, "What matters is having money so we can eat, avoid debts and get through every day.  It \[Axie Infinity] sustained our daily needs, paid our bills, and debts."  "I was thankful to Axie because somehow it helped us."  Axie, along with Helium, are crypto-economic designs that allow the participants to be rewarded by and participate in the future economic value of a network as it scales , something that was not possible even a few years ago.  

These systems, and the crypto industry as a whole, are still so nascent.  What is clear though, is that there are new crypto-economic models that are beginning to take shape allowing participants to benefit from, and participate in, network effects at a global scale.  The speed with which the crypto ecosystem moves is unmatched so the right design of a protocol can reach exit velocity sooner than anyone can predict.  Again, this is all so new but I'm betting that we'll see an increasing amount of protocols and networks designed to incentive users by rewarding them now and in the future that allow the ability to compete with and disrupt Big Tech and legacy institutions as we know them today.  

A few of the things/categories that are on the spectrum of experimentation to early implementation in the Web3 ecosystem that will have massive future ramifications are:

z-k technology (zero-knowledge proofs) basically cryptographically prove I know have something without showing you how I got it or details about --> just the clearest connection ever to protect big data and privacy once you expand upon the though.  I.E. I am who I say I am without you needing to know me email, log-in, location, and scraping my previous locations/interactions on the web to target me with an add I'm .001% more likely to buy --> future  ability to sell your data in a selective manner and receive rewards for it--> far down the line but easy to imagine 

Akash decentralized cloud storage (another attack on Amazon), hold the token that powers the cloud services and the more that the system grows, the more data it can handle, the higher the price of the coin etc, etc, 

Decentralized social media, actual economic reward for engagement, contribution of positive-sum ideas, following, etc etc.

## Disruption & Competition

JUST NEED TO TIE THIS ALL TOGETHER AND GOOD

Tie back into the broad idea of competing with big tech through incentives and rewards while simultaneously expanding the network creating network effects that are massive.  Mention other protocols listed below trying the same ideas in Web3 and the disruption we'll see in the future as these concepts evolve and adapt....AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS SO NEW, LESS THAN A FEW YEARS OLD.  

While the focus of crypto assets is often the amount of energy they use, (and this is true for PoW blockchains although often misunderstood) there are use cases being built out in real time that provide immense benefit to the consumer, all while rewarding them economic value and participation in the network.  I think we're beginning to see the actual expansion and implementation of Web3 ideas that can compete with Big Tech on a global scale as they can provide economic incentives to participates.  Network effects at a global distributed scale we haven't seen since Twitter and Facebook, all while being rewarded for every marginal increase in user adoption.  Extreme best of both worlds.

These are just two examples benefiting maybe \~250,000 people but the future ramifications are massive.  What is the future of competition and disruption if Helium can reward people for providing their own 5G internet coverage, and actually apply pressure to the massive cell providers.  If a blockchain game could apply wage pressure in emerging economies around the world, what else will develop from these underpinnings in the future?  The implications of this and crypto-economic design systems are being pushed to their limit with real-world impacts on earnings and global participation.  These things (Helium, blockchain games) have only existed since \~2019 at the earliest, and it's easy to imagine this trend continuing to emerge and having the unique ability to compete with the internet giants we know today.  The future is so bright.

Closing paragraph--> reinforce idea and protocols that are uniquely enabled by the blockchain enabled optionality of **choice to participate, rewards for participating, and share in economic upside** along with potential, more-inclusive alternatives to the big tech giants.
