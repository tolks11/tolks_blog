There are two common diatribes that slowly seem to be interconnected.  They've both been around for about the same time, but they couldn't be farther apart in their respective ethos and goals.  Of course, I'm talking about Big Tech and Crypto.  While the attacks on each have grown over the past few years, it seems as if they are becoming lumped together in a giant zero-sum game against the environment and the end consumer.  By the end of reading, I hope to present a compelling case that not only can crypto return power and choice to the consumer, but it can also do so while \~paying them\~ and letting them be active participants in the networks that can disrupt Big Tech.

The two main crypto assets (along with brief examples of similar concepts of future disruption) we'll be exploring that provide the optionality of choice to participate, rewards for participating, and share in economic upside (triple option needs workshopping) are Helium and Axie Infinity.  While Axie clearly falls into the gaming category, both of these protocols (will be used interchangeably with assets throughout) fall more broadly into a sub-sector of the crypto industry that I think will simultaneously disrupt and create a synergistic relationship with tech, Web 3.0.  [Mason Nystrom](https://twitter.com/masonnystrom) of [Messari](https://messari.io/), wrote of the best descriptions of Web3 saying, "Web3 manifests through new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, virtual and augmented reality, AI, and more.  Empowered by new technologies, the Web3 movement is spearheaded by a shift in how we, the collective, view and value the Internet.  Web3 is about creating an Internet that works for the people, owned by the people.

## Helium, The People's Network

Directly from Helium's official site, they say, "**By deploying a simple device on your home or office, you can provide your city with miles of low-power network coverage for billions of devices and earn a new cryptocurrency, HNT."**  Helium refers to itself as The People's Network because the core idea is placing a small, router like device inside your home/office (although they've expanded to more complex and wider ranging outdoor products as well) that takes a non-performance effecting amount of bandwidth from your internet provider's router and repurposes it for IoT (internet of things) LoRa capabilities.  This LoRa is provided to IoT companies (think smart devices that don't require high bandwidth to transfer data) ranging from thermostats to scooters to smart sprinkler systems to parking meters to dog trackers, etc etc {more precise ending here} for a price to the IoT provider.  The data is paid for in Data Credits {economic model here} that can be purchased with HNT.  The Helium hotspot distributes miner rewards for providing proof of coverage (similar but obviously different from proof of work BTC and proof of stake blockchains) that you can then sell for other crypto assets, convert to stablecoins (dollar pegged cryptocurrencies) and transfer to your bank, or simply hold the HNT for price appreciation.  The entire crypto-economic structure is obviously more complicated and you can read their [whitepaper](http://whitepaper.helium.com/) for more if you'd like, but I think the general idea is clear.  Syphon a bit of bandwidth from your internet provider you wouldn't use to begin with, and get rewarded for providing coverage and helping to expand the network.

Helium also recently announced a partnerhsip with FreedomFi Gateways 

Now, why are you rambling and haven't mentioned Big Tech or Amazon yet, well glad you asked.  A few weeks ago Amazon received a negative press onslaught for releasing a product they call Amazon Sidewalk. 

![press about Amazon Sidewalk](/assets/Screen Shot 2021-06-25 at 12.36.33 AM.png)

Here is how Amazon describes Sidewalk from there official site, "**Amazon Sidewalk creates a low-bandwidth network with the help of Sidewalk Bridge devices including select Echo and Ring devices.  These Bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth which is pooled together to provide these services to you and your neighbors.  And when more neighbors participate, the network becomes even stronger."**  Huh, sounds familiar.  Now, these two services are not really in direct competition but even if that was the case, the competition is not what matters here.  What is far more important, in my opinion, is the difference in incentives, data privacy, choice, and economic value provided to the consumer.  

As you saw, there was massive backlash to this announcement for a few key reasons.  First, Amazon chose to retroactively apply this upgrade to all existing Echo/Ring devices and make the terms \~opt-out\~.  If you were not aware of this upgrade, it just kind of went live and you may never have any idea that it's happening.  Obviously, in today's tech landscape creating anything that is inherently opt-in is a bold decision that is asking for regulatory scrutiny.  Second, there's no additional benefit to the Ring/Echo users.  Again, it's just happening unless you opt-out, and even if you opt-in you aren't rewarded other than maybe a little bit better service for your Ring/Echo.  

Compare the previous paragraph to what we know about Helium.  Helium is opt-in (with an up front cost of $300-$500 for a hotspot) while Sidewalk is automatically enabled.  Sidewalk participates don't see marginal increase in value while Amazon gets access to more data.  Helium hotspot owners are rewarded for coverage in the HNT token, currently trading at $12.09 per HNT (rewards vary on a number of factors).  As a quick aside check out real-time data and rewards for hotspots in your area, and globally here <https://explorer.helium.com/coverage#2.2/39.83/-65.58> .

NFTs for the rights to each pet that is purchased.  To grow these pets or breed them, you purchase SLPs (small-love potions).  You can then sell these pets or SLPs for cryptocurrency and swap into your respective currency

Another example of a uniquely blockchain enabled technology providing real-world economic value for participating in [is Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/).  

Paragraph on Axie Infinity and people in the Phillipenes making much more than the minimum wage for a uniqely crypto-economic game that rewards them for playing.

From Lean Callon-Butler, a CoinDesk columnist, "Axie Infinity is a leading game in the emerging play-toe-ern movement, where players of blockcahin games can earn yield in the form of tokens or other rewards.  Those rewards can be used in-game, or the can be traded on an open market if the player chooses.  The latter option represents an important shift in the gaming world because tradiotionally in-game assets were confined to the centralized protocol from where they came, unable to be moved off the platform."  Here, moved off the platform is taking shape in providing income, ~greater than the Phillipenes minimum wage, for players who earn in the game, convert to a stablecoin (pegged $1, likely Tether or USDC), and use the stablecoin to directly or inderctly cover their cost of living.   



Tie back into the broad idea of competing with big tech through incentives and rewarsd while simultaneiously expanding the network creating network effects that are massive.  Mention other protocols listed below trying the same ideas in Web3 and the disruption we'll see in the future as these conepts evolve and adapt....AGAIN ALL OF THIS IS SO NEW, LESS THAN A FEW YEARS OLD.  

***Thread the needle of crypto disrupting and distributing power from big tech, while also holding the belief that crypto and tech will become symbiotic over the next 10 years and beyond.***  

\    

z-k technology (zero-knowledge proofs) basically cryptographically prove I know have something without showing you how I got it or details about --> just the clearest connection ever to protect big data and privacy once you expand upon the though.  I.E. I am who I say I am without you needing to know me email, log-in, location, and scraping my previous locations/interactions on the web to target me with an add I'm .001% more likely to buy.  

Ability to sell your data in a selective manner and receive rewards for it--> far down the line but easy to imagine 

Akash decentralized cloud storage (another attack on Amazon), hold the token that powers the cloud services and the more that the system grows, the more data it can handle, the higher the price of the coin etc, etc,

These are just two examples benefiting maybe \~250,000 people but the future ramifications are massive.  What is the future of competition if Helium can reward people for providing their own 5G internet coverage, and actually apply pressure to the massive cell providers.  Could a blockchain game apply wage pressure in emerging economies around the world?  The implications of this and crypto-economic design systems are being pushed to their limit with real-world impacts on earnings and global participation.  These things have only existed since \~2019 at the earliest, and it's easy to imagine this trend continuing to emerge and having the unique ability to compete with the internet giants we know today.
