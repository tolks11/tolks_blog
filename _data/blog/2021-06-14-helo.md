Crypto is an inherently fast-moving, headline-grabbing industry that literally never stops. Days can feel like weeks and weeks can feel like quarters.While it’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day headlines that generate clicks, more important is a focus on the 5-10 year horizon and beyond. I believe the crypto industry’s impact has only just begun and represents a true paradigm shift in the way we’ll operate going forward. Below are the things I try and level myself with on a daily to weekly basis as the industry, price moves, and headlines are rapid and never ending. I purposefully went with a broad thematic list type structure as I think it is not only easier to reference to when thinking about things, but also crypto as a whole and the items listed are deeply complex and often require massive string tugging to evaluate thoroughly to arrive at first principles. This is not the only or best or maybe even right approach but it’s the one I chose to write down my thoughts that I could continue to reference in the future. If any of the points strikes a cord with you, I implore you to tug at that string but be weary of how deep the rabbit hole’s abyss is when it comes to this ever growing/changing industry.





Continual Internet expansion and digital reliance, unique coordination and incentive alignment through crypto-economic structures, composability and feedback loops, current disruption



Internet Expansion and Growing Digital Reliance 

A lot of the excitement and potential growth revolves around the new formation of an internet primitive that blockchains enable as they allow the trustless ability to transfer value to anyone, anywhere in the world with near instant settlement.

A new computing paradigm has been created which will have impacts on par with, if not greater than, the last computing paradigm shift, the smartphone.

Crypto assets allow for coordination and value transfer on the internet that were simply not possible, and this new internet primitive and the internet will continue to slowly intertwine until they are one in the same.

Marc Andreessen wrote his famous essay “Why Software is Eating The World” only 10 years ago. This has obviously been proven extremely correct with incredible foresight and the question becomes why would these things (the internet, software, and crypto not continue to exponentially grow)?

The internet driving growth, profitability, and everything in the real world (social media, navigation, constant access, business reliance, etc) has only been around for 15ish years and it’s naïve to think that it won’t continue to evolve and expand with future iterations/applications built with crypto baked into the infrastructure.

Software, the internet as a thing we rely on, and the crypto industry are still in the earliest stages and have orders of magnitude in growth left as these are new human primitives whose future timeline is infinite and forever.

Crypto is almost entirely software dependent and doesn’t rely on people building actual real world infrastructure so the pace of innovation, change, and experimentation is only limited to the amount of developers and time in a day.

Everyone born into the world from 2000 onwards isn’t aware of the concept of the “internet” or “being online” as they have been interacting with it their entire lives which in turn reinforces the early nature of these things as we are just beginning to see the impacts of an entire generation, and all future generations, born into technology already existing that slowly but increasingly includes crypto assets.

Crypto can be extremely opaque, abstract, and requires a certain level of technological understanding from the user, but those requirements are slowly becoming easier over time while everyone is becoming increasingly technologically savvy which will continue to lead to growth in adoption MoM, YoY just as it has it’s inception.

This is an amazing overview with good data and charts on internet adoption and growth from <https://ourworldindata.org/internet> where the title is, “The Internet’s history has just begun”.

It will become increasingly clear that a bet on the internet and continued growth and expansion of the entire tech industry (which is increasingly the world industry) will be a bet on the expansion and inclusion of crypto assets.



Coordination and Incentive Alignment

Community formation and active participation/free flow of ideas and contributions at a global scale that hasn’t been possible.

Open-source structure

True global scale and reach and near instant communication/exchange of value with anyone in the world at an anytime; genie is out of the bottle and not going back in with regards to programmable money and near instant settlement times no matter your geographic location, identity, race, religion, etc.

Coordination and true return to meritocracy;  if you provide value to a protocol that is open source by nature, i.e. the flow of ideas and contribution aren’t guarded in anyway, then you share in the upside of the protocol.

Economic incentive alignment and coordination at a global scale are two of the most difficult problems in the world, both of which can be potentially solved by crypto-economic structures.

Alignment of incentives and active participation in the protocols that have minimal barriers to entry and are actual meritocracies i.e. can be an anonymous person with 75 followers but if you have proof of work and knowledge you can contribute and even end up being hired.

Innovation and human coordination always win in the long run, and crypto is still at the earliest stages of that.

Capture more value that you create through incentive alignment and open, fair systems.

Massive increased coordination across the globe and all continents, covid showed how possible it is to be remote and crypto is by far the easiest transfer of payments for coordination mechanisms across time zones and countries.

Ability to incentivize and align everyone involved in the ecosystem to participate in and works towards a common.



Composability and Feedback Loops

Since crypto and DeFi are all open source the industry shares the unique ability to use what has been termed “money legos”.Primitives that are built in the crypto ecosystem can be iterated upon and combined to create entirely new structures/protocols that interact with and create value for each other.

Truly open, global systems benefiting from open-source code that provides economic value hasn’t existed.The explosion of the internet and everything built on top of it became possible because of the open-source nature.Applying this concept to the transfer, value, and base protocol layer of money will continue to expand the possibilities of the industry.

Being a purely open and global system not only allows for maximum composability, it also allows immediate testing and experimentation with real economic value that has never been possible.

Economic and incentive structures can be built into new protocols and tokens which are tested in real time, with real money. For good and bad, it creates pseudo randomized control trials of new ideas and innovations that if designed correctly have immense upside.

This creates feedback loops and innovation at a pace that allows for enormous scalability in a short amount of time when one of these new money lego primitives is either built, modified, or combined with another protocol

Price appreciation in certain tokens, protocols, or the industry as a whole also creates natural flywheels where price goes up, massive attention is allocated, resources and new, young developers are attracted to the ecosystem and build things that inevitably feed into the next price appreciation that restarts the flywheel.

As long as this holds true, talent will continue to enter the ecosystem and contribute to its future growth continually advancing and expanding the flywheel.



Current Disruption & Growth

DeFi product market fit and value accrual tokens distributing fees back to users, permissionless ability to issue and receive loans.

Also, smart contracts and the programmability of payments/distribution with royalty fees being coded into the contract forever.

Beginning stages of exploring the possibility to write if/then statements directly into code that can handle money and transact trustlessly, instantly online in seconds to minutes.

NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and their ability to uniquely represent digital items.

Founder of the world wide web auctioning off the original code as an NFT is quite the prescient loop.

Gaming application along with art and.

All of these have made undeniable contributors to unlock value in ways that did not exist before blockchains and crypto and they will always have these values ad infinitum throughout history.How much value they unlock and their ability to continue to grow is an entirely different conversation.

Beyond all the hype and headlines, MoM, YoY growth metrics in active addresses (wallets) and TVL continue to have insane growth.



Entire drivers that need their own post: 

Web3, Ownership Economy, NFTs, & the gaming industry (3 Billion people worldwide) all operating seamlessly together



Many of these components are specifically broad and could be broken down into long micro-analysis but that’s not the goal of this post. The goal is to have an aerial view of the crypto ecosystem as a whole and what I think of as potential factors that do/will continue to support the growth of the industry. Many parts of the crypto ecosystem often delve into the abstract concept of money, it’s supply and velocity and the unsustainable nature of quantitative easing and fiat money as a concept. While I generally agree with these assumptions, I don’t think it’s the optimal way to push the crypto ecosystem forward and would rather focus on the coordination and technological advancements the industry allows so the theory of money and value were intentionally left out. Ultimately, having a new industry emerge that is open source, maximally inclusive, composable and possesses the ability to programmatically enforce rules written into code that can handle monetary transactions limits the scope of what’s possible to the collective human imagination. The future is so bright.
