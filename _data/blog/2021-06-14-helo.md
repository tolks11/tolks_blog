Crypto is an inherently fast-moving, headline-grabbing industry that literally never stops. Days can feel like weeks and weeks can feel like quarters.While it’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day headlines that generate clicks, more important is a focus on the 5-10 year horizon and beyond. I believe the crypto industry’s impact has only just begun and represents a true paradigm shift in the way we’ll operate going forward. Below are the things I try and level myself with on a daily to weekly basis as the industry, price moves, and headlines are rapid and never ending. I purposefully went with a broad thematic list type structure as I think it is not only easier to reference to when thinking about things, but also crypto as a whole and the items listed are deeply complex and often require massive string tugging to evaluate thoroughly to arrive at first principles. This is not the only or best or maybe even right approach but it’s the one I chose to write down my thoughts that I could continue to reference in the future. If any of the points strikes a cord with you, I implore you to tug at that string but be weary of how deep the rabbit hole’s abyss is when it comes to this ever growing/changing industry.

Overarching concepts to drive future growth: 

* Increasing global digital reliance 
* Blockchains enabling unique coordination and incentive alignment
* Composability & Interoperability 
* Rapid flywheel/feedback loops
* Continual Internet growth and expansion 



### Internet Expansion and Increasing Digital Reliance 

A lot of the excitement and potential growth revolves around the new formation of an internet primitive that blockchains enable as they allow the trustless ability to transfer value to anyone, anywhere in the world with near instant settlement.

A new computing paradigm has been created which will have impacts on par with, if not greater than, the last computing paradigm shift, the smartphone.

Crypto assets allow for coordination and value transfer on the internet that were simply not possible, and this new internet primitive and the internet will continue to slowly intertwine until they are indistinguishable in Web 3.0.

Marc Andreessen wrote his famous essay “Why Software is Eating The World” 10 years ago. This has obviously been proven extremely correct with incredible foresight and the question becomes why would these things (the internet, software, and crypto) not continue to exponentially grow?

The internet driving growth, profitability, and everything in the real world (social media, navigation, constant access, business reliance, etc) has only been around for ~15 years and it’s naïve to think that it won’t continue to evolve and expand with future iterations/applications built with crypto baked into the infrastructure.

Software, the internet as a thing we rely on, and the crypto industry are still in the earliest stages and have orders of magnitude in growth left as these are new human primitives whose future timeline is infinite and forever.

Crypto is almost entirely software dependent and doesn’t rely on people building actual real world infrastructure so the pace of innovation, change, and experimentation is only limited to the amount of developers and time in a day.

Everyone born into the world from 2000 onwards isn’t aware of the concept of the “internet” or “being online” as they have been interacting with it their entire lives which in turn reinforces the early nature of these things as we are just beginning to see the impacts of an entire generation, and all future generations, born into technology already existing that slowly but increasingly includes crypto assets.

Crypto can be extremely opaque, abstract, and requires a certain level of technological understanding from the user, but those requirements are slowly becoming easier over time while everyone is becoming increasingly technologically savvy which will continue to lead to growth in adoption MoM, YoY just as it has it’s inception.

This is an amazing overview with good data and charts on internet adoption and growth from <https://ourworldindata.org/internet> where the title is, “The Internet’s history has just begun”.

It will become increasingly clear that a bet on the internet and continued growth and expansion of the entire tech industry (which is increasingly the world industry) will be a bet on the expansion and inclusion of crypto assets.

### Coordination and Incentive Alignment

The open-source structure of crypto combined with the proper alignment of incentives and modern social media communication channels allows for true global community formation and idea generation where every participant in the ecosystem can share in financial upside.  

Global ease of access (an internet connection and amount >= price) to tokens representing projects has unlocked coordination and facilitated growth unlocks that were previously unachievable do to a combination of regulatory barriers and an arbitrary amount of equity in a company required to participate in growth plans.

I've personally seen anonymous people participating in and contributing ideas to communities that end up being implemented by the protocol after a consensus vote by said community.  Often times this person is retroactively rewarded with payment in protocol tokens or another currency of their choice and sometimes even hired full time by said protocol. 

Implementation of these ideas is an insanely efficient process that can happen in as little as a week or even days and highlights the unique ability of participants to directly contribute to, and coordinate with, protocols which in turn benefits all involved parties. 

The above also benefits from truly global scale and is not limited to a required amount of equity(tokens), the ability to attend a conference/meeting, or vary from state to state, country to country applicable regulations. 

This description also illuminates another positive externality of the crypto industry which is often times a true meritocracy.  There are VC raises and exclusive deals which is natural in a system that requires capital for growth, but overwhelmingly if you can add value to a protocol you will be valued inside said protocol again without geographic, race, religion, gender etc. restrictions.

Economic incentive alignment and coordination at a global scale are two of the most difficult problems in the world, both of which can be potentially solved by crypto-economic structures uniquely enabled by blockchain distributed tokens.

Open participation, innovation, and human coordination always win in the long run, and while the crypto industry is still in it's earliest stages, the benefits are clear.

All of the above is currently being explored and iterated upon even further with new exciting coordination mechanisms for protocols and a group of people with the same interests in the form of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).  DAOs have the potential to continue to transform the future of work and coordination, but like most things in crypto require an at length dissection of their own.

### Composability and Feedback Loops

Since crypto and DeFi are all open source the industry shares the unique ability to use what has been termed “money legos”.Primitives that are built in the crypto ecosystem can be iterated upon and combined to create entirely new structures/protocols that interact with and create value for each other.

Truly open, global systems benefiting from open-source code that provides economic value hasn’t existed.The explosion of the internet and everything built on top of it became possible because of the open-source nature.Applying this concept to the transfer, value, and base protocol layer of money will continue to expand the possibilities of the industry.

Being a purely open and global system not only allows for maximum composability, it also allows immediate testing and experimentation with real economic value that has never been possible.

Economic and incentive structures can be built into new protocols and tokens which are tested in real time, with real money. For good and bad, it creates pseudo randomized control trials of new ideas and innovations that if designed correctly have immense upside.

This creates feedback loops and innovation at a pace that allows for enormous scalability in a short amount of time when one of these new money lego primitives is either built, modified, or combined with another protocol

Price appreciation in certain tokens, protocols, or the industry as a whole also creates natural flywheels where price goes up, media attention is allocated, resources and new developers are attracted to the ecosystem and build things that inevitably feed into the next price appreciation that restarts the flywheel.

As long as this holds true, talent will continue to enter the ecosystem and contribute to its future growth continually advancing and expanding the flywheel.

### Current Disruption & Growth

There are three main categories that I think have clearly found product market fit and point to ongoing adoption beyond all of the hype, headlines, and noise that the crypto industry entails: DeFi (decentralized finance), smart contracts, and growth in key metrics.

Certain DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols having value accrual tokens distributing a portion of fees back to users, and the permissionless ability to issue and receive over collateralized loans.  A specific example of a protocol's token distributing a portion of fees back to token holders would be SushiSwap.  Sushi is a DEX(decentralized exchange) that uses an AMM (automated market maker) strategy for trades that takes a small percentage of fees from each swap (trade) performed on the protocol and redistributes it to token holders.  COMP (Compound) and AAVE are two examples of lending and borrowing protocols. 

Smart contracts and the programmability of payments/distribution with royalty fees being coded into the contract forever, specifically applicable to the sale and resale of NFTs.  For example, any percent of a future sale of an NFT can be programmed to be sent to the original creator's address ad infinitum.  This has powerful implications for future creation and the ability to have infinite value flow to the original creator of something every time it is resold for the rest of time. This also feeds into the point of how early it still is as we are just exploring the beginning stages of the ability to write if/then statements directly into code that can handle money and transact trustlessly, instantly, and online in seconds to minutes not matter your location, race, religion, identity.

Metrics (from <https://duneanalytics.com/home> and <https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data>) that represent growth and also the early stage we still find ourselves at considering the TAM. 

*  \~216,000 DeFi users exactly a year ago compared to \~2,816,000 today (June 16, 2021)
* DEX volume May \~$256,400,000 compared to \~$173,170,000,000 May 2021
* Net Value Locked in DeFi June 2020 \~$1.24B compared to \~$41.47B June 2021
* Stablecoin ($1 pegged coins) Supply June 2020 $11.66B compared to $106.43B June 2021
* There is an endless amount of on-chain (programmatically verifiable) data that exhibits the above growth patterns I would encourage you to explore

DeFi and smart contracts have made undeniable contributions to unlock value in ways that did not exist before blockchains and crypto. How much value they unlock and their ability to continue to grow and innovate is the central question we'll see play out of the next decade plus and will contribute to the continued YoY growth of the industry.

Entire sectors of the crypto industry that contribute to growth that need their own deep dive that were left out here: Web3, DAOs, The ownership economy, NFTs, & the gaming industry (3 Billion people worldwide) interoperating together in the near future.

Many of these components are specifically broad and could be broken down into long micro-analysis but that’s not the goal of this post. The goal is to have an aerial view of the crypto ecosystem as a whole and what I think of as potential factors that do/will continue to support the growth of the industry. Many parts of the crypto ecosystem often delve into the abstract concept of money, it’s supply and velocity and the unsustainable nature of quantitative easing and money as a philosophical concept. While I generally agree with these assumptions, I don’t think it’s the optimal way to push the crypto ecosystem forward and would rather focus on the coordination and technological advancements the industry allows so the theory of money and value were intentionally left out. Ultimately, having a new industry emerge that is open source, maximally inclusive, composable and possesses the ability to programmatically enforce rules written into code that can handle monetary transactions limits the scope of what’s possible to the collective human imagination. The future is so bright.
